# Cadastrin 

Python GUI project based on a MVC architeture with data
persistence. <br> 

This project was the final test from the lecture
'Development of Object Orientated Systems I', ministred at
UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina). <br>

The main objective of the program it is to control events in
a pandemic scenario, doing that by assigning specific events
to specific party producers, and, connecting a list of
participants (that may have be registered on the system and ensure some pandemic precautions) to those specific events 

### :warning: Warning

---

Unfortunatelly, the code isn't 100% correct and
functional, however, it was important for understanding and
learning many important (and specific) aspects of developing
systems from scratch with MVC architeture. <br> 

### :dart: Future Objectives

---

- Translate the code from pt-br to en-us
- Correct any bugs that may exist
- Correct the GUI functionality
- Make it functional :laughing:
